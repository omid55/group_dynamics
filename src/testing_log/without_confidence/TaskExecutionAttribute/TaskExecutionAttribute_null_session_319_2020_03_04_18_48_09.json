[{"question":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Imagine that you have been given a total of 100 chips. Distribute these chips to indicate the relative importance of each member to determine your own final answer on this problem. The number of chips that you allocate to a particular member should indicate the extent to which that member provided information that you personally found useful and caused you to modify your approach to the problem. The number of chips that you allocate to yourself should indicate the extent to which your final answer was not affected by the conversation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">If the conversation had no influence on you, then put 100 for yourself. If the conversation caused you to abandon your approach to the problem, then put 0 for yourself and allocate all the chips to one or more of the other members. If you did not entirely abandon your own approach to the problem, then put a number greater than 0 beside your name and allocate the remainder to one or more others.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><br></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><b>Please enter both numbers.&nbsp;</b></span></li><li><b style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Sum of both numbers should add up to 100.</b></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><b><br></b></span></p>","type":"introduction"},{"question":"Number of chips to yourself:","type":"text","placeholder":"[0 - 100] %"},{"question":"Number of chips to the other person:","type":"text","placeholder":"[0 - 100] %"}]
